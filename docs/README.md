#       Project 01-blink_project_01

##      Hardware

        ESP32 development board
        2 Tact switch
        3 LEDS: read, yellow, green
        3 pullup resistors 220 ohm
        Jumper wire

##      Connections

        From GND from ESP32 development board to both negative (blue) rails on both sides

        Cathode of each LED is connected to GND, anode to one side of pullup resistor and
            the other side of pullup resistor to respectivve IO
        NS_RED, NS_YELLOW and NS_GREEN are connected to each color circuit LED
        
        Tact switches are connected on one side to GND and other side to respective GPIO
            i.e., PUSH_NS and PUSH_EW
