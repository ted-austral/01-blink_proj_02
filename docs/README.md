##      Hardware

        ESP32 development board
        2 Tact switch
        Jumper wire
        Filter capacitor

##      Connections

        From GND and from 3V3 on ESP32 development board to both negative (blue) and positive rails of one side

        From GPIO18 to one side of Tact switch 0
        From the other side of Tact switch to positive (red) rail
        From GPIO19 to one side of Tact switch 1
        From the other side of Tact switch to positive (red) rail

        Between both power supply rails (red and blue, a capacitor in order to filter 3V3 power supply
